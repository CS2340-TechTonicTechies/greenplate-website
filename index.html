    <h2>In Review</h2>

    <p>GreenPlate is a collaborative project with the intent to create and design an app that promotes sustainable food management for its users; we believe we have achieved that goal. Throughout the design and coding process, we faced many challenges: version control, tight deadlines, etc. Nevertheless, through our group efforts, we have come together to make the app you see demoed here. There are a lot of moving parts integrated into an intuitive, easy-to-use design.
    </p>
    <p>All of our team members contributed to the app as needed during the span of two-week sprints. Under the given time constraints, we realized how interdependent our tasks and features were which thus changed our workstyle and influenced our scheduling as well. Overall, we learned how to work better as a team through productive in-person and online meetings to accomplish our goals.
